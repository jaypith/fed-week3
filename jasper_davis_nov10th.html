		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="jasper_img1.png">
		<p>My name is Jasper Davis, currently I am employed as a graphic designer at a small digital signage company called <a href="http://www.unoapp.com">Unoapp</a>. At Unoapp I am a designers. I am taking this course in order to expand my skill set. At Unoapp I design primariy digital signage for restaurants. Most of our clients get menuboards. As Unoapp expaned, we are doing more and more high end websites. I find designing for web much more interesting compared to designing relatively static menuboards and digital signage. Therefore I decided to apply to bitmaker labs as a means to shift my career towards a focus on web design. </p>

Other interests and hobbies include drawing and painting, although I find myself rarely doing either these days.  I enjoy camping & hiking, as well as biking. I also very much enjoy reading, and love the apolocaplytic genre. </p>
